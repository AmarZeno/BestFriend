You rush into your Postgraduate Orientation Session.
You see an empty chair next to a pretty girl.
Walking over, you slip on the first stair and fall flat on your face.

The voice is coming from behind you.

You finish another drink as a colleague tells you about their summer.
You drunkenly yell, "Crank the music!" and stumble onto the dance floor.

"Hi, I'm Jamie! Alex told me all about you."

You and Alex chose to share a hotel room.

"Some friends and I are headed down to the lobby bar, either of you want to come?"
They both nod in acceptance and smile, then head downstairs.
You start to stroll down the stairs to the lobby when you feel light-headed.
You wake up 13 hours later in a hospital bed. Your head is wrapped in bandages.
Alex teases you about having to be your mother since you obviously can't take care of yourself.

You awake to the sound of your phone's message tone. It's Jamie asking you to call.
You open the email. It's a response to your graduate job application.
You're excited. No - sad. And excited. You immediately think about Alex and Jamie.
You make a decision but you think you should at least discuss it with friends.
