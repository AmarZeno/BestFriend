You're already late.
Don't worry. People notice.
You choose to sit next to the girl.
Dont worry. People notice.
I will though."
This is the day you meet Alex.
You never really liked Dave.
You're definitely too drunk to dance.
You go over there and see what's going on.
You collide on the dance floor in a giggly mess.
This is the day you become friends with Alex.
This is your second big conference.
You've been working on this presentation for weeks. You hope you are going to do alright.
It's Jamie.
Say you are going to work for only 30 more minutes and will come down for a drink.
You pull on your jacket and head downstairs.
Black and nothing.
Later Alex tells the whole story.
This is the day that you become best friends with Alex.
The morning sunlight pours through your window.
You also notice you have one new unread email.
It says the job is in New York.
You decide to take the job.
You pick up your phone and start to make some calls.
