You scramble to get your notebook from your bag.
You see an empty chair next to a handsome boy.
You hope nobody saw and quickly slink away to an empty seat near the back.
"Don't worry. Jamie won't remember that...
You turn around to be confronted with the biggest smile you've ever seen.

The first few chords of a song you know all too well spit out of the stereo. You wonder if your too drunk to dance.
You notice Alex talking to someone just off to the side.
Before you can do anything, Alex gestures in your direction and pushes the friend towards you.
You can see Alex's big smile out of the corner of your eye.

"Don't worry! You've been working on this presentation for weeks, you're going to do great! Right now you should just relax," Alex tells you.
There is a knock at the door.
"Yes!" Alex says jumping up. "I bet you Captain Stresshead isn't coming though," gesturing in your direction.
Forty minutes pass and you realize you haven't eaten all day. Maybe it's time for a break.
And then black and nothing.
Alex is asleep in a chair across from you.
Alex's hands are noticably shaking.
Your Apartment, Downtown Salt Lake City. May 28th, 2016. 11:13 AM
You smile. You've been dating for almost 6 months now.
"Congratulations, your application has been accepted."
You lay on your bed for almost an hour considering the opportunity.
You think you'll invite a few friends around tonight. You haven't seen a bunch of people since graduation.
This is the day you find out Alex is dead.
