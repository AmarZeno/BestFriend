You enter your first Postgraduate Orientation Session late.
You see an empty chair next to a beautiful girl.
Walking over, you slip on the first lecture stair and fall straight on your face.
"Dont worry. Jamie won't remember that...
The voice is coming from behind you.

You finish another drink as a colleague tells you about their summer.
You drunkenly yell “Crank the music!” and stumble on to the dance floor.
Before you can do anything, Alex gestures in your direction and pushes his friend towards you.
“Hi, I’m Jamie! Alex told me all about you."

You and Alex share a hotel room for a national networking conference.
There is a knock at your door.
“Me and some friends are headed down to the lobby bar, either of you want to come?”
They both nod in acceptance and smile, then head downstairs.
You start to stroll down the stairs to the lobby when you feel light-headed.
You wake up 13 hours later in a hospital bed. Your head is wrapped in bandages.
He says he saw the whole thing as he was coming up to check on you.

You awake to the sound of your phone’s message tone. Its Jamie asking you to ring.
You open the email. Its a response to your graduate job application.
You're excited. No, Sad. And Excited. You immediately think about Alex and Jamie.
You make a decision but you think you should at least discuss it with friends.
