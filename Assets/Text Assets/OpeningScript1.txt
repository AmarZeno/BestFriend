You see an empty chair next to a beautiful girl.
Walking over, you slip on the first lecture stair and fall straight on your face.
"If you wanted to impress Elliot, you should have rocked that fall, she loves goofy dudes"

You drunkenly yell “Crank the music!” and stumble on to the dance floor.
Before you can do anything, Alex gestures in your direction and pushes Elliot towards you. You collide on the dance floor in a giggly mess.
Level 3, Scientific Sessions Conference Center, Chicago. November 18th 2014. 8:12 PM
There is a knock at your hotel room door. Its Elliot. “Me and some friends are headed down to the lobby bar, either of you want to come?”
They both accept your answer and leave. 40 minutes’ pass and you realise you haven’t eaten all day. Maybe it is time for a break.
You wake up 13 hours later in a hospital bed. Your head is wrapped in bandages. Alex asleep in a chair across from you.
Your Apartment, Downtown Salt Lake City. May 28th, 2016. 11:13 AM
You open the email. Its a response to your graduate job application. “Congratulations, your application has been accepted to start work next month”.
After lying in bed for 30 minutes considering your response, you make a decision but you think you should at least discuss it with friends.
