You enter your first Postgraduate Orientation Session late.
You see an empty chair next to a handsome boy.
You hope nobody saw and quickly slink away to an empty seat near the back
The voice is coming from behind you. You turn around to be confronted with the biggest smile you've ever seen.
You just finish your 9th vodka as Dave tells you about his summer. Daft Punk comes on the stereo. You wonder if your too drunk to dance.
You notice Alex and Elliot having a private conversation just off the dance floor.
“Hi, I’m Elliot! Alex told me all about you. You can see Alex’s big smile out of the corner of your eye.
“Your going to be great tomorrow! You’ve been working on this for months! Right now you should just come relax.” Alex tells you.
"Yes!” Alex says jumping up. “I bet you Captain Stresshead isn’t coming though.” Gesturing in your direction.
You get up from the floor and pull on your jacket as you wonder what food they sell down at the lobby bar.
Later on, Alex tells how you passed out while walking down the stairs. He says he saw the whole thing as he was coming up to check on you. He says how scared he was.
You awake to the sound of your phone’s message tone. Its Elliot asking you to ring. You smile. You’ve been dating for a year now.
You are suddenly filled with excitement which retreats to sadness when you think about Alex and Elliot. The job is in New York.
You think you’ll invite a few friends around tonight. You haven’t seen a bunch of people since graduation. You pick up your phone and start to make some calls.
