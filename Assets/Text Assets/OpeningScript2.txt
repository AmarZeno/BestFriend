You see an empty chair next to a handsome boy.
You hope nobody saw and quickly slink away to an empty seat near the back
i will though."
You turn around to be confronted with the biggest smile you've ever seen.

Those first few chords of a song you know all too well spit out of the stereo. You wonder if your too drunk to dance.
Out of the corner of your eye, you notice Alex talking to someone just off the dancefloor.

You can see Alex’s big smile out of the corner of your eye.

“Don't worry! You've been working on this presentation for months, you're going to do great! Right now you should just relax,” Alex tells you.

"Yes!” Alex says jumping up. “I bet you Captain Stresshead isn’t coming though.” Gesturing in your direction.
Forty minutes pass and you realize you haven’t eaten all day. Maybe it's time for a break.
And then black and nothing.
Alex asleep in a chair across from you.
He says how scared he was. He trys to pretend his hand isnt still shaking.

You smile. You’ve been dating for almost 6 months now.
“Congratulations, your application has been accepted..”.
You lay on your bed for almost an hour considering the opportunity.
You think you’ll invite a few friends around tonight. You haven’t seen a bunch of people since graduation. You pick up your phone and start to make some calls.
This is the day you find out Alex is dead.
