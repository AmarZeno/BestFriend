Dont Worry. People Notice.
You choose to sit next to the girl.
Dont Worry. People Notice.
This is the day you meet Alex.
You’re definitely too drunk to dance.
You go over there and see what’s going on.
This is the day you become friends with Alex.
Your papers are everywhere. You have a big presentation tomorrow. You have been working on it for weeks.
Say you are going to work for only 30 more minutes and will come down for a pint.
You start to stroll down the stairs towards your friends when all of a sudden you feel light headed and then nothing.
This is the day that you become best friends with Alex.
You also notice you have one new unread email.
You decide to take the job.
This is the day you find out Alex is dead.
