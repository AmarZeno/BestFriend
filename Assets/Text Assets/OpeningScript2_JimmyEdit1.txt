You see an empty chair next to a handsome guy.
You hope nobody saw and quickly take a seat near the back.

You turn around to the biggest smile you've ever seen.

A song comes on the stereo, met with cheers from around the room.
You walk over to Alex and his friend.
You collide in a giggly mess.
You can see Alex’s big smile out of the corner of your eye.

“Don't worry! You've been working on this presentation for months, you're going to do great! Right now you should just relax,” Alex tells you.
"Yes!” Alex says jumping up.
Tell them you're going to work for another half hour and then come down.
Forty minutes pass and you realize you haven’t eaten all day. Maybe it's time for a break.
And then nothing.
Alex is asleep in a chair across from you.
Alex describes every moment leading up to your fall, and afterwards.

You smile. You’ve been dating for a year now.
“Congratulations! We are delighted to offer you the opportunity..."
You decide to take the job.
You think of inviting some friends around tonight. You haven’t seen a bunch of people since graduation.
