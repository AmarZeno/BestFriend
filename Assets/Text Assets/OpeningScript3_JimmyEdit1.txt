Sit next to the girl.
Don't worry, people notice.

This is the day you meet Alex.

You get the urge to dance.
You squeeze into the dance circle and show your moves.

This is the day you become good friends with Alex.

There is a knock at your door.
“I bet you Captain Stresshead isn’t coming though,” nodding in your direction.
Tell them you need to work on your presentation and then go straight to bed.
You get up and pull on your jacket as you wonder what food they sell down at the lobby bar.


Alex describes the overwhelming fear and paralyzation when calling first responders.

You also notice you have one new unread email.

You decide to turn down the job.
You pick up your phone and start to make some calls.
