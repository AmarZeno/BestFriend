You arrive at your first Postgraduate Orientation Session late.
You see an empty chair next to a pretty girl.
Walking over, you trip on the first stair and fall flat on your face.
"You're fine. Nobody's going to remember that spill you took in a week.
The voice is coming from behind you.

You take another sip of your drink as a colleague tells you about their summer.
You walk toward a circle of people moving to the beat when you notice Alex off to the side laughing with someone.
Before you can do anything, Alex gestures in your direction and pushes his friend towards you.
“Hi, I’m Jamie! Alex told me all about you.”

You and Alex share a hotel room for a national networking conference.
“Some friends and I are headed down to the lobby bar, either of you want to come?”
Your papers are scattered everywhere. You have a big presentation tomorrow.
They both nod in understandment and smile, then head downstairs.
You start to stroll down the stairs to the lobby when you feel light-headed.
You wake up ten hours later in a hospital bed. Your head is wrapped in bandages.
Later on, Alex tells how you passed out while walking down the stairs.

You awake to the sound of your phone’s message tone. It's Jamie asking you to call.
You open the email. It's a response to your graduate job application.
Your excitement quickly retreats to sadness when you think about Alex and Jamie. The job requires you to relocate.
After taking the morning to consider your choices, you make a decision, but feel you should discuss it with friends first.
